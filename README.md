# **Cost-Effective Smart Hydroponic Monitoring and Controlling System using IoT** 🌱💧

## **Project Overview**
This project introduces a **Smart Hydroponic System** that utilizes **IoT (Internet of Things)** to monitor and control essential parameters in a hydroponic farming setup. The system automates the maintenance of **pH levels, temperature, humidity, and water levels**, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth.

## **How It Works**
1. **Sensors** (pH, temperature, humidity, and water level) collect real-time data.
2. The data is transmitted to an **IoT-based cloud platform** for remote monitoring.
3. A **mobile application** displays the system status and alerts users.
4. **Automated control mechanisms** adjust water flow and nutrient supply based on sensor readings.
5. The system ensures optimal plant growth without requiring manual intervention.
